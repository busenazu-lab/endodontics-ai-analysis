# endodontics-ai-analysis
Python-based analysis scripts developed with AI assistance, reviewed and adapted by the author for academic research purposes.

## Usage
Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
Run: `python src/grade_homeworks.py`

## Purpose
This script was developed to support the evaluation of preclinical endodontic homework
by automatically calculating adjusted scores based on letter grades and submission delays,
and by generating a consolidated summary sheet for instructors.

## Scope and Limitations
The script is designed for structured Excel files following a predefined format.
It does not perform data validation beyond basic checks and assumes consistent
color-coding and grading conventions defined by the instructor.

## Language Variants and Modular Design

-`grade_homeworks_turkish.py` 
In addition to the original batch grading script, the project includes
a modular structure and a Turkish-language implementation to improve
usability in local educational settings.
